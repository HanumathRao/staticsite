    <h3>Leverage the Precog platform to rapidly and easily perform analytics on JSON, key-values, and other NoSQL data.</h3>
    <p>NoSQL data stores are being rapidly adopted by developers around the world because they support non-relational data like JSON.</p>
    <p>But NoSQL data stores are designed for operational use, not for analytics, which means many companies are forced to export their NoSQL data to Hadoop or relational data stores to perform any analytics. Both of these options are extremely time-consuming, fragile, and expensive.</p>
    <p>Precog provides a disruptively simple alternative: simply perform analytics directly on your NoSQL data. No ETL, no normalization, and no MapReduce or other coding. Precog lets you do everything from data wrangling, to historical analytics, to predictive analytics, in one simple, easy-to-use, high-performance tool set built from the ground-up for NoSQL data.</p>
    <p>Unlock the value of your NoSQL data today with the industry's leading NoSQL analytics platform!</p>
