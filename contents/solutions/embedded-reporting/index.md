    <h3>Leverage the Precog platform to quickly and simply deploy gorgeous, insightful reporting in your app that will give your customers deep insights into their business problems.</h3>
    <p>If you have a cloud-based platform targeted at businesses, then you can help your customers make better business decisions by giving them self-service analytics and reporting. With Precog, you can differentiate your platform from the competition, add tremendous value, and delight your customers by giving them the self-service reporting they crave.</p>
    <p>Most B2B SaaS vendors build extensive end-user reporting into their products to help provide their customers with actionable insight. This reporting starts out very simple, but over time, customers demand new ways of viewing the data and more sophisticated analytics, leading to endless one-off reports and complexity that quickly spirals out of control.</p>
    <p>Precog lets you rapidly and easily deliver an Enterprise-class analytics and reporting solution seamlessly embedded into your product, with both the features your customers are demanding today, and also the features they will demand tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    <ul class="two-column-list">
        <li>
            <h3>Give your customers insight.</h3>
            <p>Without insight into all the activity that's happening in your platform, your customers are powerless to optimize their business processes. Give them the insight they need to make the best possible decisions for their business.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Simple, flexible security model.</h3>
            <p>You need access to all the data, but each of your customers and third-party stakeholders should only be able to access some data. Precog's powerful security model handles even the most complicated use cases with ease.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>No data warehouse to manage.</h3>
            <p>Precog acts as the primary authority for data you need to report on to your customers. You don't have to manage a complicated data warehouse, so you can focus on making your your core competency.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>No software to install or maintain.</h3>
            <p>Although there are open source reporting solutions, they are legacy technology, and very difficult to install, maintain, and upgrade. Precog is always up to date and continuously getting better.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Embeddable report builder.</h3>
            <p>Drop a GUI report builder into your app in seconds, so your customers can create customized reports that slice and dice data the way they like. Put an end to one-off reports and endless SQL queries.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Embeddable data analysis tool.</h3>
            <p>For your advance customers, consider embedding a custom-branded version of <a href="/products/labcoat/">Labcoat</a>. Let your data-savvy customers do whatever they like with their data, all while maintaining complete control over that data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Customizable visualization API.</h3>
            <p>ReportGrid's API makes it a piece of cake to create interactive charts and reporting dashboards that you can embed into your app. Style it <em>your way</em> with our support for industry-standard CSS.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Don't be just another data silo.</h3>
            <p>With Precog, your customers have the ability to link the data you give them access to with all of their other data. If you build your own solution, you will end up becoming another data silo for your customers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Scale with your customers.</h3>
            <p>Many reporting engines only have the ability to do simple aggregations. Precog has the ability to perform advanced statistics and machine learnings to power intelligent reporting that demolishes the competition.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Comprehensive REST APIs.</h3>
            <p>Consume all of Precog's functionality from any device, any operating system, and any platform. Precog's powerful REST APIs are backed by a growing collection of client libraries to make life simpler for developers.</p>
