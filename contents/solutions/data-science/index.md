    <h3>Leverage the Precog platform to perform interactive, ad hoc analysis of any kind of data from any kind of source.</h3>
    <p>Business analysts, data scientists, and Business Intelligence (BI) analysts are facing increasing pressure to analyze large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. Legacy tools require rigid schemas and costly ETL. They only support small amounts of data. They can't combine multiple data sources, and they can only perform simple aggregations and rollups. </p>
    <p>Precog's data science platform lets you break free of the shackles of legacy data analysis tools. In a single, unified, easy-to-use tool called Labcoat, Precog allows you to perform data ingestion, integration, transformation, and analysis of large volumes of multi-structured data from any number of data sources.</p>
    <p>With Labcoat, you can now interactively perform advanced, ad hoc analysis across all your data, no matter where it's from or how much structure it has.</p>
    <p>Say goodbye to the pain of legacy data analysis tools. Say hello to the next-generation of data science.</p>
