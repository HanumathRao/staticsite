<h1>Precog for PostgreSQL ChangeLog</h1>

<h2>Version 1.1.0</h2>

<ul>
<li>Added support for hstore and json columns</li>
<li>Numerous bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Note:</em> While json and hstore columns are supported for read,
 PostgreSQL doesn't currently support key/property level queries
 against them. Because of that, any queries that utilize hstore or
 json columns will read all contained column data before filtering
 down to only the required columns.</p>

<h2>Version 1.0.0</h2>

<ul>
<li>Initial release</li>
</ul>
