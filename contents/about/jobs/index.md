<h2>Why work for Precog?</h2>
<p>Precog is headquartered in the beautiful foothills of the Rocky Mountains, in the city of Boulder, Colorado.</p>
<p>Boulder is home to a vibrant and growing tech community, some of the best restaurants in the nation, and some damn fine coffee (and lots of it!). Boulder is a biker and pedestrian friendly town, walking distance from hiking trails, a short 30 minute drive from ski resorts, and close to Denver for when you want the big city.</p>
<p>At Precog, we work on the really hard problems like big data, analytics, machine learning, statistics, distributed computing. If it's complex and relevant to turning raw data into intelligence and insight, then you can bet we're working on it (or soon will be).</p>
<p>We have a phenomenal team of all-star players, including book authors, open source contributors, mathematicians, and computer scientists. We hire only the best, which means a challenging work environment where you are pushed to learn and excel.</p>
<p>We currently don't have any job openings, but feel free to <a href="/about/contact-us/">contact us!</a> Thanks for checking us out.</p>
