    <h2>What do I get from Precog that I can't do myself?</h2>
    <p>Precog is a cloud platform, so there's nothing for you to install or maintain. The service scales to meet your needs, whether you have a small amount of data or a large amount of data, a small number of queries or a large number of queries.</p>
    <p>Precog offers an integrated marketplace for data cleaning, enrichment, and processing. With a few clicks in your control panel, you can take any data you're storing in Precog and clean or enrich it with amazing add-ons like sentiment analysis, demographics, and facets.</p>
    <p>Finally, Precog offers <a href="/products/labcoat/">extremely sophisticated</a> analytics and statistics. While you could build these features on top of a file system like Hadoop, it would take a long time and a lot of effort.</p>
    <p>This combination of features gives you a tremendous amount of functionality with virtually no effort. We don't solve your problems for you, but we do make it easier for you to focus on your problems, rather than the technology that so often gets in the way.
