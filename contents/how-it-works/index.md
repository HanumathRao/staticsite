        <h1>HOW IT WORKS</h1>
    </div>
    <div id="your-data" class="stage-text">
        <h2>YOUR DATA</h2>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Capture, upload, or synchronize semi-structured data into Precog. Precog can natively store any JSON data, including strings, objects, arrays, booleans, numbers, date times, and combinations of those types.</p>
            <p>Precog doesn't replace your operational database, but works alongside it to power advanced analytics.</p>
            <p>Your operational database is great at storing <em>dynamic data</em>. Dynamic data typically describes the current state of entities (like people, places, products, or other things), and needs to be updated in response to user input.</p>
            <p>Precog is designed for persistent data, which describe observations of a system captured by a machine. Examples of persistent data include event-oriented data, machine-generated data, transactional data, behavioral data, sensor data, and measurement data.</p>
            <p>Together, your operational database and Precog allow you to maintain state, and also perform both historical and predictive analytics across observational data.</p>

    <div id="our-marketplace" class="stage-text">
        <h2>OUR MARKETPLACE</h2>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Precog's marketplace contains a growing collection of applications that help you enrich your data with a few clicks!</p>
            <p>Your data may be dirty, contain unstructured data, have missing information, or need to be tied together with other data.</p>
            <p>With legacy systems, you would have to write long, complex, and fragile ETL scripts to enrich your data. But with Precog, it's as simple as simple as dragging and dropping different apps to create a workflow, which can intelligently and automatically enrich your data.</p>
            <p>Some apps extract structured data from unstructured data, like taxonomies, concept tagging, entity extraction, and sentiment analysis. Other apps detect field types, such as emails and phone numbers, so you don't have to identify them manually. Still others complete partial information, add third-party data, or clean up dirty data.</p>
            <p>No matter how you need to enrich your data, the Precog marketplace will help you do it quickly, easily, and robustly!</p>

    <div id="smart-integration" class="stage-text">
        <h2>SMART INTEGRATION</h2>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Apps work together seamlessly and intelligently, without any configuration.</p>
            <p>The core apps in the Precog marketplace rely heavily on machine learning. If you want to augment emails with name information, you can use a semantic identification app (which will automatically identify and annotate any emails, even in unstructured data!), followed by an email augmentation app (which will look for emails and augment them). Thanks to the power of machine learning, no configuration is required!</p>
            <p>With Smart Integration, you don't have to manually identify field types, perform field mappings, and other tedious chores. Most apps can be configured just by pointing and clicking your mouse.</p>
            <p>Smart Integration. It's what data integration looks like in the 21st century!</p>

        <h2>QUIRREL</h2>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Precog has industry-leading support for Quirrel, the simple "R for big data" language that will make you fall in love with data analysis!</p>
            <p>Quirrel combines a very simple and modular core (which you can learn in about 30 minutes), with great expressive power that lets you solve even advanced problems in analytics, statistics, and machine learning.</p>
            <p>Our documentation center is packed with Quirrel snippets for all common analytics (just copy and paste them into Labcoat!), as well as Quirrel tutorials, and even a fun game that will teach you Quirrel while you run from zombies.</p>
            <p>Discover just how fun data analysis can be with the world's only language built for data science!</p>

    <div id="deployment" class="stage-text">
        <h2>DEPLOYMENT</h2>
        <div class="right">
            <p>Precog lets you deploy any analytics as executable code and interactive reports!</p>
            <p>Most analytics software stops at "insight". Once you've learned something, if you want to deploy those findings, so you can build intelligent features and data products, then you're on your own.</p>
            <p>Precog goes the full mile.</p>
            <p>After you've developed a useful analyses or predictive model, you can deploy the analytics as code in any programming language of your choice. Copy and paste that code into an application to easily build features like embedded reporting, personalizations, predictions, recommendations, fraud detection, and much more.</p>
            <p>Build the next-generation of insightful, intelligent, data-driven applications with Precog!</p>
