# Visualization API

## Introduction

Precog's Visualization API is a JavaScript API that can help you quickly build charts and interactive reporting dashboards.

You can embed these charts and reporting dashboards into web apps, mobile apps, and web pages.

There are two different components to the Visualization API: [Charts API](/developers/viz-api/charts-api), and [Data Transform API](/developers/viz-api/transform-api/).

## Charts API

The [Charts API](/developers/viz-api/charts-api/) lets you easily create interactive charts, including pie charts, bar charts, funnel charts, stream graphs, geo charts, heat maps, and much more.

The Charts API relies on HTML5 technology, but has fallbacks for older browsers.

## Data Transform API

The [Data Transform API](/developers/viz-api/transform-api/), which is bundled into the Charts API, helps you massage data immediately prior to visualizing the data.

Many times, data needs to be grouped, filtered, sorted, or otherwise transformed before it can be displayed by the Charts API. The Data Transform API lets you do all of these things in a very clean, composable way.
