<p>We've been thinking about how to tell our <a href="http://www.precog.com/">Precog</a> story so that anyone (even granny who is baffled by technology) understands what we do, how we do it, and how it can help developers with their analytics and reporting. I think we've got the answer and luckily, it's jam-packed into a 90-second <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzBsLNlF0Bk">animated video</a>. See for yourself below:</p>
