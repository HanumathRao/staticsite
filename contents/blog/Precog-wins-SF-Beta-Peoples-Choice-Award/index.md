<p>Last week the Precog team had the pleasure to attend <strong>SF Beta: Data Week Edition</strong>, as part of our west coast Data Week trip. As you might be aware, SF Beta is San Francisco's popular startup mixer, combining live demos, interactive competition and open socializing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.precog.com/">Precog</a> was one of several big data startups that entered the interactive competition, which also included entries from WikiSeer, MetaMarkets, GoodData, Spinn3r, DataStax and Chart.io. As part of the contest, Precog provided a demo of our Precog data warehousing and analysis platform and our front-end Labcoat IDE. Four hundred demo viewers were asked to contribute poker chips, each representing a monetary value, to the demo that they felt was the most compelling.</p>
<p>The result? Precog cruised to a crushing $80 million in 'investment,' capturing its first ever SF Beta People's Choice Award and becoming the third consecutive startup based outside of the Bay Area to win SF Beta.</p>
