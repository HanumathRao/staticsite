<p>I was recently reading a Harvard Business Review article, <a href="http://hbr.org/2007/10/manage-your-energy-not-your-time/ar/1">Manage Your Energy, Not Your Time</a>, and was pleased, although not terribly surprised, to realize that Precog embraces this philosophy wholeheartedly.  The central idea of the article is that time is a finite resource and the temptation to respond to increasing workloads by working longer hours is a recipe that leads to long term detrimental effects.  Working additional hours can get things done in the short run, but employee health, engagement and satisfaction can all suffer.  Instead it makes sense to focus on energy and productivity over time spent on a task.</p>
<p>Precog's dedication to this principle is epitomized by a commitment to a daily fitness break lead by CEO <a href="http://blog.precog.com/about/team">John De Goes</a>.</p>
<p>Mondays and Thursdays are functional training: compound, whole-body exercises that build functional strength and cardiovascular fitness, and prepare muscles for negatives.</p>
<p>Tuesdays and Fridays are body building training: heavy weights, isolation exercises and assisted negative that build mass (especially after functional days).</p>
<p>The benefits of this practice are many:</p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>Taking any break during the day helps provide perspective on a problem and allow the subconscious some time to gnaw away at it.</li>
<li>Exercise is a great way to mitigate stress, heighten mental acuity and increase focus.</li>
<li>Group activities create bonding opportunities that enhance trust and communication among participants.</li>
<li>Long term health benefits lead to fewer sick days and increased productivity.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>I haven't worked this hard since basketball practice in high school, but it feels good and is certainly good for me. It helps to have a couple of strength-training experts on the team, but if you aren't that fortunate, you could at least go on a walk together.  Throw in a sprint while you're at it</p>
