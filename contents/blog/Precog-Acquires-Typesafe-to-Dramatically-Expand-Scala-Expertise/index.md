<h3><strong>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Precog Acquires Typesafe to Dramatically Expand Scala Expertise</strong></p>
<p>Boulder, CO &#8211; April 1, 2013 &#8211; In a surprising turn of events that only a true &#8220;precog&#8221; could foresee, <a href="http://www.precog.com/">Precog</a>, a major vendor of advanced analytics technology for multi-structured data, today announced the acquisition of <a href="http://typesafe.com/">Typesafe</a>, the commercial company devoted to support, training, and services for the open source Scala programming language. Terms of the acquisition were not disclosed.</p>
<p>This acquisition marks a remarkably early exit for the fast-growing company Typesafe, which raised its first round in 2011. Funded by Greylock Partners, Shasta Ventures, and Juniper Networks, Typesafe has raised approximately $17M in the past two years, and employs dozens of individuals, many of whom are well-known and respected in the Scala programming community.</p>
<p>Precog&#8217;s entire technology stack was developed using the <a href="http://typesafe.com/technology/scala">Scala programming language</a>, and Precog&#8217;s engineering team is well-known in the Scala community. The engineers frequently speak at Scala conferences, such as the recent Northeast Scala Symposium.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;Typesafe has done a tremendous job of making Scala ready for Enterprise. The language, libraries, community, support, and training now available make Scala the hands-down winner of the JVM language wars,&#8221;</em> says John A. De Goes, CEO of Precog.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;This acquisition will allow Precog to continue to grow its team from among the finest the Scala industry has to offer,&#8221;</em> says Mr. De Goes.</p>
<p>Members of the Precog engineering team are committed to typelevel.scala, the trio of advanced type-level Scala libraries, including Scalaz, shapeless, and Spire. Precog&#8217;s acquisition of Typesafe raises the possibility that these libraries may be included in a future Scala distribution, a highly controversial possibility that is frequently discussed on Twitter by members of the Scala programming community.</p>

<h3><em>*Obviously, this is an April Fool&#8217;s joke, and our way of praising all that Typesafe has accomplished in the past two years. Well done, crew, and see you at the next Scala Conference!</em></h3>
