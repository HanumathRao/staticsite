<p>Precog, the market-leading provider of analytics as a service, today announced that it has partnered with GridGain Systems, a real time big data software company, to offer a real-time data analysis solution. Labcoat by GridGain is a breakthrough analytics platform created from the fusion of two best-in-breed technologies: the data analysis technology of Precog, and the in-memory big data technology of GridGain.</p>
<p>With an interactive environment for data analysis, Labcoat empowers data analysts, data scientists, and business users to integrate, analyze, and visualize massive volumes of structured or semi-structured data. Powered by GridGain&#8217;s highly-scalable, in-memory data platform, Labcoat helps businesses answer their deepest questions with real-time performance and Enterprise-class scalability.</p>
<p>"GridGain has proven itself the platform of choice for real-time big data applications. More Fortune 500 businesses rely on GridGain's in-memory big data platform than any other vendor," said Nikita Ivanov, Founder &amp; CEO of GridGain. "Now with Labcoat, GridGain has the unprecedented ability to perform sophisticated analytics with a simple user-interface and no coding."</p>
<p>The Labcoat environment with the Quirrel evaluation and execution engine is sourced from Precog, while the in-memory scalable data grid is sourced from GridGain. The fusion of the two technologies is seamless and the entire package is available as a single download (no installation is required for Labcoat, as the software is web-based).</p>
<p>"For decades, companies have used legacy SQL systems to analyze data. But legacy systems can't keep up with today's exploding volumes of data, and they can only answer simple questions about data." says John A. De Goes, CEO of Precog. "With Labcoat by GridGain, companies can now mine any amount of data to find answers to the deepest of questions, with blisteringly fast performance. It's a revolution in data science."</p>
