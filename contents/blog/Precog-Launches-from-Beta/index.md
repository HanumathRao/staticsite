Today's an extraordinarily special day for Precog and I've got some incredibly exciting news to share. News that comes around at most once in a product's lifetime. 

After 6 months in public beta, Precog is announcing that we are exiting beta and entering into general availability. We are officially opening our doors and accepting unlimited numbers of production accounts!

A huge thanks to the more than 1300 companies who have taken us for a spin. You've given us a tremendous amount of valuable feedback, you've put up with rough edges and warts, and you've inspired us to make our technology faster, better, and easier to use.

I also owe an equally large debt of gratitude to the Precog team members who have worked so hard in getting to where we are today.

You guys and gals have worked tirelessly in making our product better with each passing today. You've put your love and your passion and your expertise into Precog, and you have made raving fans out of a growing number of customers. I'm extremely proud of all of you!

As part of the launch, you'll notice a bunch of improvements on the frontend:

*   A brand new website, easier to understand and to navigate.
*   Completely redesigned account signup, login, and management, which make it easier than ever to get started with Precog.
*   Brand new and completely overhauled client libraries for our REST API.
*   Simple and transparent pricing across our whole stack.
*   Cleaner and better documentation than ever before.
*   Immediate availability of our on-premises solution, in both a hardware appliance and a virtual appliance (thanks to popular demand!).

You'll also notice we've forked the home page into two different tracks: one for businesses, and one for developers. Each group has different needs. 

One wants to think in terms of business value and solving business problems, and the other wants to think in terms of how Precog works and what Precog can do at a technical level. By forking the home page, we can direct each group to content they want to see, rather than trying to aim for a middle-ground that confuses business stakeholders and doesn't contain the juicy technical details that developers need.

Please give our [new site](http://www.precog.com/) a whirl, and consider [signing](http://www.precog.com/account/login/) up for a free account in our managed cloud. If you have any feedback, please send it on to me directly at [john@precog.com](mailto:john@precog.com).

Thanks again to everyone who made this day possible!
