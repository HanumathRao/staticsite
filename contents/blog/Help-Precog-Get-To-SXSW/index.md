<p>We need your help! Last month, we submitted a session on <a href="products/labcoat/quirrel">Quirrel</a> to the <a href="http://sxswedu.com/">SXSWedu</a> program in Austin, Texas. The session is called &#8220;<a href="http://panelpicker.sxsw.com/vote/8793">Big Data Science &amp; Introduction to Quirrel</a>&#8221; and will be presented by John A. De Goes, our CEO/Founder and Chairman of the Quirrel language committee.</p>
<p><strong>Public voting ends this Friday</strong> and we&#8217;d love all the support we can get!</p>

<p><strong>Session Description:</strong> The enormous amount of data being captured by machines is increasingly being analyzed by applications to drive smart features, like recommendations, predictions, and decision-making. Deeply analyzing petabyte-scale datasets is no easy task. Many tools in the big data ecosystem allow superficial analysis of data, but digging deeper is much more challenging. Quirrel is a statistically-oriented language designed principally for data analysis. It combines a purely-declarative, implicitly parallel design with features needed by data scientists.</p>
<p>In this presentation, John A. De Goes (chairman of the Quirrel language committee) introduces Quirrel and shows how it can be used to solve problems across large data sets and describes how this shift is revolutionizing the application space, in everything from digital advertising to e-commerce.</p>
