<p>Next Tuesday our team will be speaking to the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/">R User Group</a> in Denver. If you're in the area, please come and hear our Developer Evangelist, Nathan Lubchenco, talk on "<a href="http://www.meetup.com/DenverRUG/events/106221902/">Quirrel and How it Relates to R</a>" in this Meetup at UC Denver on April 16th at 7pm.</p>
<p>Nathan will talk about talk about a statistically-oriented query language called "Quirrel" and its similarities and differences with R. While <a href="http://quirrel-lang.org/">Quirrel</a> is neither as mature as R nor situated in such a robust ecosystem, it is easier to learn and simple to deploy results. In addition to some basic functionality, a predictive model will be created and discussed. Quirrel, sometimes referred to as the "R for big data" query language, is a new language designed specifically around modern needs for analyzing large amounts of semi-structured data.</p>
