<p>Concrete examples provide a powerful way to understand abstract concepts (such as Analytics and Data Science Platform). In order to better understand how <a href="http://www.precog.com/">Precog</a> is a <a href="http://www.precog.com/solutions/data-science">Data Science Platform</a> that allows you to perform analytics, we created a demo company and reporting dashboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www2.precog.com/socialsauce">SocialSauce</a> is a fictitious company built using different aspects of the Precog platform. SocialSauce is a social media analytics company that monitors a Twitter feed, analyzes the content of mentions and outgoing tweets and shows the sentiment scores. The <a href="http://www2.precog.com/socialsaucedashboard">SocialSauce dashboard</a> gives the customer real-time access to <a href="http://www.precog.com/solutions/embeddable-reporting">embedded reporting</a>.</p>
<p>The customer in this demo is <a href="http://www.fullcontact.com/">FullContact,</a> our friends at a local Denver startup. They offer a contact management API and also have a lively Twitter channel over at <a href="https://twitter.com/fullcontactapi">@FullContactAPI</a>. Below is a screenshot of the dashboard, but you’re better off going to the <a href="http://www2.precog.com/socialsaucedashboard">interactive and real-time dashboard</a> to see for yourself!<br />

<p><a href="http://www2.precog.com/socialsaucedashboard">SocialSauce</a> reports Twitter analytics using our ReportGrid charts:</p>
<ul>
<li>What time of day do people tweet about your company? (Bar chart)</li>
<li>What is the ratio of your outgoing tweets to mentions? (Sankey)</li>
<li>How many of your tweets get retweeted?  (Sankey)</li>
<li>How positive is the image of your company on Twitter?</li>
<li>What categories do your tweets fall into? (Pie chart)</li>
<li>What are some of the common keywords in tweets? (Leaderboard)</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information about these charts, check out the <a href="http://www.precog.com/products/reportgrid">ReportGrid</a> visualization library.  Also, if you want to dig deeper into the data and explore it with our interactive development environment, just simply click on a chart in the dashboard to see the query in <a href="http://www.precog.com/products/labcoat">Labcoat</a>.</p>
<p>Precog is an integrated platform that makes all of this possible.  Precog makes it easy to capture and store data which can then be enhanced or augmented.  In this example, the data is enriched by sentiment, category and concept analysis.  This data can then be displayed in an embedded reporting dashboard for easy access by customers.</p>
