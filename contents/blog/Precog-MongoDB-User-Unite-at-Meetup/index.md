<p><a href="blog-precog-2/entry/teaming-up-with-10gen-to-bring-precog-to-mongodb">Earlier this month</a>, we teamed up with 10gen to launch a <a href="mongodb">Precog implementation of MongoDB</a>. So far, the response has been outstanding and we want to do everything we can to support the users. We&#8217;ve added a Precog for MongoDB section to our <a href="developers#mongodb">Developer Center</a> and our support team has been responding to emails, but we want to do more. So, we&#8217;ve put together an event in Colorado!</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re fortunate to be located in Boulder, we&#8217;d like to take advantage of being surrounded by many developers and the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/boulder-denver-mongo/">MongoDB Community</a>! Everyone is invited to the first <a href="http://www.meetup.com/boulder-denver-mongo/events/91541192/">Precog &amp; MongoDB Meetup</a> in Boulder! Here are the details:</p>
