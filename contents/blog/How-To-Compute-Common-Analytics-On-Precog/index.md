<p>To help make it easy to get started analyzing data and deploying a data-driven application, we’ve added a new How To article in the <a href="http://precog.com/developers">Developer Center</a>. This <a href="http://precog.com/developers/how-tos/common-queries">How To Compute Common Analytics on Precog</a> provides examples of common types of queries.  All of the examples are written so they work in the demo version of <a href="http://labcoat.precog.com/">Labcoat</a>, but they should be easily modifiable to work with your data.</p>
<p>The guide covers basic operations like counts, sums and averages.  It also includes examples of more advanced operations like computing an hour-by-hour histogram or a time windowed query.  Each code snippet includes a "Labcoat" button that will launch the query and allow you to play with the example.</p>
