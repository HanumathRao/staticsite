<p>Summer always seems to fly by, but this one especially has flown by at a supersonic speed and before we knew it the Precog team had grown by six! Since I joined Precog as Director of Marketing a little over a month ago, we added three engineers from across the globe. (I didn't hold the "newbie" badge for very long.) Now I&#8217;d like to introduce our newest (and very clever) engineers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/tixxit">Tom Switzer</a> from Toronto, Canada (a Boulderite as of 4 days ago!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/puffnfresh">Brian McKenna</a> from Brisbane, Australia (soon-to-be a Boulderite!)</li>
<li><a href="http://www.twitter.com/d6">Erik Asheim</a> from Montreal, Canada (makes the Boulder winters seem mild)</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll meet them online or run into them at a conference (they frequently speak at events) but believe me when I say we have an extremely talented team here at Precog. I am so honored to be a part of this company and very excited for the things to come. In fact, the photo above is a sneak peek from our adventurous photo shoot we had here in Boulder and we&#8217;ll post more monkey photos very soon (hint: click on the photo for a fun surprise). Enjoy!</p>
