<p dir="ltr">In the past, we've hosted webinars on the Precog platform but it's always been a challenge to find enough time to present our deck, demo our tools &amp; answer questions. This month, I'm hosting a <a href="http://precog.com/webinars/march">series of webinars</a> focused on a variety of topics so we can go into more detail and focus on a particular area of the platform.</p>
<p>Take your pick of the series or attend all three! You can learn how to perform analytics in our data science application, create interactive charts, and embed a reporting dashboard in your application!</p>
