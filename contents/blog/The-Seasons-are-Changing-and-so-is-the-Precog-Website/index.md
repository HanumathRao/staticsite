<p>Here at the Precog HQ, we've decided to give our website, <a href="http://www.precog.com/">www.precog.com</a>, a refresh! What does this mean for you? It means that we&#8217;ve added new pages and updated our navigation on the site. Now with most company site refreshes, this means re-learning the site navigation and tons of boring new text to read. While we have changed navigation and added new pages, we&#8217;ve also added cool graphics to keep you interested. A Precog Zombie on the <a href="http://www.precog.com/">homepage</a> and <a href="about/team">action shots of the team</a> to name a few (updated bios and more photos in the coming weeks)!</p>
