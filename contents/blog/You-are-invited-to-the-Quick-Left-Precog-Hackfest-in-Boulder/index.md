<p>We&#8217;ve partnered up with our Pearl Street neighbors, <a href="http://www.quickleft.com">Quick Left</a>, to host a <a href="http://jan2013quicklefthackfest.eventbrite.com/">Hackfest</a> on January 30. Here&#8217;s your chance to show off your mad software development skills, drink cold beer, eat tasty pizza and win some cool prizes. Bonus points awarded to the team who incorporates the  <a href="http://www.precog.com/products/reportgrid">ReportGrid API</a> into their web collaboration tool. We&#8217;ll be around to help answer any questions and give you some ideas!</p>
<p>Build web collaboration tools in the language of your choice and don&#8217;t worry about forming a team beforehand (teams can get together night of). Developers, designers, and spectators are welcome. You&#8217;ll have three hours to get busy coding! So come play for a bit. Kicking off at 6:30 sharp. <a href="http://jan2013quicklefthackfest.eventbrite.com/">Sign up today!</a></p>
