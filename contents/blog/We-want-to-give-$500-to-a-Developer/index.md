<p>Precog is attending the <a href="http://developerweek.com/">DeveloperWeek Conference</a> in San Francisco from February 1st through the 7th. As part of this event, we are also participating in the <a href="http://www.developerweek.com/index/scholarships">Scholarship Program</a> and would like to give <strong>$500</strong> to a developer who develops an app with Precog (a strong application will propose an interesting use of Precog's API-driven technology).</p>
<p><a href="https://data2.wufoo.com/forms/developerweek-2013-scholarship-application/">Submit an application</a> as a team of up to four people by January 18th and make sure to mention "Precog" when asked for the sponsored scholarship. The candidate will then work on the app during DeveloperWeek and will also have a chance to present their app on February 6th at DeveloperWeek!</p>
