<p>If you've been to our <a href="http://www.precog.com/">website</a> this week, you might have noticed we launched a re-design and added more useful content. In addition to this launch, we also updated our <a href="http://www.precog.com/developers">Developer Center.</a></p>

<p>To start, we added a search bar in the upper right-hand corner so you can immediately find what you're looking for! Type in a keyword such as <a href="http://www2.precog.com/s/17892/e1369a4926353556f972788c89f928c2?q=security&amp;noRecord=true">"security"</a>and see how easy it is to find the articles that cover your topic.</p>
<p>In addition to easier navigation, we've also added some great additional content.  The first <a href="http://www.precog.com/developers/how-tos/embed-reporting">How To</a> is a step-by-step guide about how to get started with Precog and quickly get a dashboard embedded in your application.  Documentation for the <a href="http://www.precog.com/client-libraries/ruby">ruby</a>, <a href="http://www.precog.com/client-libraries/python">python </a>and <a href="http://www.precog.com/client-libraries/java">java</a> client libraries have also been added.  You can also check out how to try <a href="http://www.precog.com/precog-on-mongodb">Precog for MongoDB</a>, our open source offering that uses MongoDB as a backend instead of our cloud-based solution.</p>
