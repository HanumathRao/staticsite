    <h2>Quirrel Analysis Language</h2>
    <p>Quirrel, sometimes referred to as the "R for big data" query language, is a new language designed specifically around modern needs for analyzing large amounts of semi-structured data. The language finds a common ground between the need to express highly complex analytical calculations, and the need to support efficient and automatic parallelization and distribution across large clusters of data nodes.</p>
    <p>The Quirrel language was initially conceived and designed by Precog, a data analytics company, although the standard has since been opened sourced, and an independent advisory panel directs evolution of the language.</p>
    <p>Quirrel was designed to perform analytics and Quirrel allows users to answer big data questions that previously would have required substantial software engineering resources to answer. <a href="http://quirrel-lang.org/">Learn more.</a></p>
