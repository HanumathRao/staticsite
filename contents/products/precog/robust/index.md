        <li>
            <h3>99.999% SLA.</h3>
            <p>Our five-nines uptime SLA guarantees our data ingest API will have no more than 6 seconds of downtime a week. Thats 50x less downtime than the Amazon EC2 SLA promises.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Zero planned downtime.</h3>
            <p>We upgrade and replace both hardware and software in a seamless way that doesn't require any downtime. We also keep customers informed of maintenance through email, <a href="http://twitter.com/precogstatus">Twitter</a>, and our IT blog.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Religious backups.</h3>
            <p>All data you send to Precog is stored in no less than two places, as well as backed up to a multiply-redundant archive for long-term safekeeping. Even with multiple failures on our backend, we still won't lose any of your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Multi-week transaction log.</h3>
            <p>We store a full transaction log of at least two weeks that contains a copy of all the changes you have made to your Precog data store. It's kept on separate systems from both the primary data store and the backups.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cross data center deployment.</h3>
            <p>Our software is deployed across multiple data centers, so even in the event one data center goes down, we can still process requests.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Third-party monitoring.</h3>
            <p>Our APIs are continuously monitored by Pingdom for any downtime events, and we publicly host the results. Check out our track record for yourself by visiting our <a href="http://status.precog.com/">API status page.</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Multiply redundant systems.</h3>
            <p>Every aspect of Precog is designed to survive the failure of nodes in any given tier. Any machine can go down at any time, and it will not affect your service level or jeopardize your data.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Versioned APIs.</h3>
            <p>We have full versioning built into all of our APIs. Anytime we make a backward-incompatible change, we publish a new API. We support the older APIs for as long as it takes to ensure all customers have migrated to the latest APIs.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Rigorous automated tests.</h3>
            <p>We have tens of thousands of automated tests that run against our software before every deployment, as well as continuous API tests that run against our API.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fanatical support.</h3>
            <p>Have a question about our reliability, our backups, our system architecture, or the software, tools, and languages we use to build and deploy our software? We're here to <a href="/about/contact-us/">answer</a> all your questions!</p>
