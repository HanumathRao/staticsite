    <h2>Thinknear</h2>

    <h3 class="quote-font">"Working with the Precog / ReportGrid team has been fantastic. The product was simple to setup, and the team has been incredibly responsive and wonderful to work with."</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.thinknear.com" target="_blank">ThinkNear</a> is a next-generation mobile advertising platform capable of targeting ads to within 100 meters of any location.</p>
    <p>With access to billions of mobile impressions, and a critical business requirement to provide insightful analytics to their customers across these vast data sets, ThinkNear had a choice: build and maintain an in-house solution, or leverage the Precog big data analytics platform.</p>
    <p>After spending just a couple of hours with Precog's simple REST APIs, ThinkNear benchmarked the Precog platform at rates of more than 5,000 records a second. ThinkNear then proceeded to do a complete production integration in less than two week's time. Now ThinkNear uses Precog to power all analytics for all their customers across massive sets of advertising data.</p>
    <p>Without Precog, ThinkNear would have had to devote full-time, dedicated resources and many years to building and maintaining an in-house solution. Now ThinkNear is able to devote those same resources to critical features in their mobile advertising platform, features that are rapidly making ThinkNear the premier solution for targeted mobile advertising.</p>
    <h2>Snapengage</h2>
    <img src="/images/graphic-logo-snapengage.png" border="0" align="right" class="body-image-right"/>
    <h3 class="quote-font">"Thanks to Precog, SnapEngage's awesome analytics and reporting features were up and running in no time. Precog customer service is second to none; they are always eager to help. Thanks Precog!"</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.snapengage.com" target="_blank">SnapEngage</a> is an online sales and support tool designed to help companies improve customer conversion and retention.</p>
    <p>One of the challenging problems SnapEngage is faced with is capturing all interactions between support agents and website visitors, and performing sophisticated analytics on that data to identify patterns, trends, and correlations that help support managers improve conversion and retention.</p>
    <p>When SnapEngage came to Precog, they were using Google App Engine Datastore to store interaction data. But the cumbersome data model and lack of first-class support for analytics made it difficult and expensive to iterate based on customer feedback, or look at data in new ways.</p>
    <p>Using Precog, SnapEngage completely overhauled their analytics and reporting in a matter of days, and now has the freedom to quickly and nimbly iterate in response to customer feedback, and provide their customers with extremely deep insight into the support process, and its effects on conversion and retention. </p>
    <h2>Flixmaster</h2>
    <img src="/images/graphic-logo-flixmaster.png" border="0" align="right" class="body-image-right"/>
    <h3 class="quote-font">"Precog custom designed a sankey for us, which has garnered nothing but praise and admiration since it was implemented. We consider Precog to be an invaluable partner for us, and a key component to our success."</h3>
    <p><a href="http://www.flixmaster.com" target="_blank">FlixMaster</a> is a platform for creating and hosting interactive, branching videos designed to maximize engagement.</p>
    <p>When FlixMaster created a new kind of video, they needed a new kind of analytics - analytics that went far beyond plays, abandons, and engagement rates. FlixMaster needed powerful ways to track millions of users as they took dozens of different paths in videos, and sophisticated analytics to correlate particular paths with conversions, demographics, customer segments, and more.</p>
    <p>FlixMaster decided to put the Precog platform to the test. In less than 4 weeks, the company launched a revolutionary analytics feature in their platform that uses Precog to capture, enrich, analyze, and visualize the millions of pieces of interaction data for every one of their customers.</p>
