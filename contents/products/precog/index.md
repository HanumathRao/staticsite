                <h1>Precog FAQ</h1>
                <h3>What is Precog?</h3>
                <p>Precog is a data science platform designed for storing, integrating, and analyzing semi-structured, persistent data.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Storing.</strong> You can capture data directly from applications using Precogs API. You can also upload data from your desktop or synchronize from a database or data warehouse. Precog is designed to function as the primary authority for your persistent data, but can also work alongside any other systems you have. In any case, Precog does not replace your need for an operational data store to handle entity-oriented data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Integrating.</strong>Precog allows you to define workflows used to preprocess data on ingest. These workflows are comprised of modular units called apps, which can be used to perform structural refinement, de-duping, natural language processing, semantic tagging, enrichment, and joining. Workflows require little to no configuration and flexibly adapt to handle heterogeneous data and data with varying levels of structure.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Analyzing.</strong> Precog supports the statistically-oriented language called Quirrel, which provides a simple way to perform in-store analytics, statistics, and machine learning on persistent data. In addition, Quirrel is extremely adept at performing data wrangling and data integration, as well as manipulating heterogeneous and semi-structured data sets.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Semi-structured.</strong> Precog can store any kind of semi-structured data, ranging from lines in a log file, to heavily nested data structures containing maps, objects, arrays, and primitives. You can natively store JSON documents inside Precog without performing any ETL process, and of course, Precog can handle structured, relational data as well.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p><strong>Persistent Data.</strong> Precog is designed for storing persistent data. Persistent data is any kind of data representing facts or measurements, which does not need to be mutably updated (operational databases handle dynamic data, which needs to be updated in response to external changes). Examples of persistent data include events (users clicking, engaging, and buying), sensor data, activity stream data, clickstream data, transactional data, and measurement data.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Precog was designed to be easy to integrate into applications and workflows, so all of Precog's functionality is exposed by REST APIs, which are documented in our Developer Center. Client libraries are available in JavaScript, Python, PHP, Ruby, Java, C#, and other common programming languages.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog have tables?</h3>
                <p>Tables help developers organize data that has similar schema (collections serve a similar purpose in many NoSQL databases). Precog does not support tables, but supports a more flexible organizational mechanism modeled after file systems.</p>
                <p>When you store data in Precog, you need to choose a location in the file system to store the data. If you choose a location that does not exist yet, it will be created automatically.</p>
                <p>The file system supports any number of levels, so you can organize your data in ways that are far more flexible and fine-grained than tabular organization.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog support security?</h3>
                <p>Most databases have no meaningful security model. Precog, because it's designed to be used by web, mobile, and server applications, has a very robust security model built-in.</p>
                <p>The security model revolves around the file system, and lets you give very fine-grained permissions to different API keys. Precog uses the same security model to provision customer accounts, and you can use the security model to provision your own customers or users (who could do further provisioning, if they have the appropriate permissions).</p>
                <h3>What kind of data does Precog support?</h3>
                <p>The Precog data model is a strict superset of the JSON data model. Any valid JSON can be stored unmodified in Precog.</p>
                <p>JSON can be nested to any depth. For example, instead of having table containing customers and a table containing addresses, you can store all a customer's addresses inside a single object:</p>
                <pre>{
"customerId": "12312321",
"addresses": [{"address": "221 B Baker Street"}, {"P Sherman 42, Wallaby Way"}]
}
                </pre>
                <p>Because Precog lets you store data in denormalized form, you can often avoid doing costly run-time joins, which do not scale well as your data volume increases.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog support schemas?</h3>
                <p>Precog doesn't require you to specify schemas upfront. However, Precog will detect duplicated schemas and only store the schema once, to increase runtime performance.</p>
                <p>Unlike relational databases with strict schemas and strong normalization requirements, Precog makes it easy to store denormalized data or dirty data, and refine the structure and content of your data over time.</p>
                <h3>What language is Precog written in?</h3>
                <p>Precog is implemented in Scala. Scala is a high-performance, functional / object-oriented hybrid language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine. Scala is used to create high-performing, distributed software by Twitter, FourSquare, LinkedIn, Netflix, and many other leading technology companies.</p>
                <h3>What languages can I use to work with Precog?</h3>
                <p>Precog supports a growing collection of client libraries. If you use a language that doesn't have a client library, just let us know and we'll add it for you!</p>
                <h3>Does Precog support SQL?</h3>
                <p>No. SQL is an excellent language for storing, retrieving, and aggregating entity-oriented data, but most kinds of data science are not possible using SQL. Precog supports Quirrel, a highly expressive data analysis language that makes it easy to do data wrangling and data science (including analytics, statistics, and machine learning) across any kind of persistent data.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog replace my existing database?</h3>
                <p>No. Precog works alongside your existing entity-oriented database to store all the persistent data generated from your application. Precog cannot be used as an operational data store for mutable data, just like your existing operational database cannot be used for data science (databases support basic aggregation, but cannot perform data wrangling, structural refinement, statistics, machine learning, and predictive analytics).</p>
                <p>Persistent data is immutable. Therefore, Precog doesn't have the ability to update or delete single records. However, persistent data you store in Precog can reference mutable entities in your operational store, and you can use the Entity Resolution app to snapshot entities that are referenced by your persistent data.</p>
                <h3>What are typical uses for Precog?</h3>
                <p>Precog is a flexible data science platform that provides a rapid way to solve many problems in embeddable reporting, NoSQL analytics, data science and data productization. In general, if you want to store, process, and analyze persistent data, then Precog is a good fit and will outperform other technologies for this specific use case.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog support transactions?</h3>
                <p>Since Precog is designed to support immutable persistent data, it does not support transactions in the classic relational sense. However, Precog does support the reliable storage (with acknowledgement) of persistent data.</p>
                <h3>Are writes written to disk immediately, or lazily?</h3>
                <p>Precog immediately writes data to a transaction log, which is used to build out the main data structures that Precog uses to store data. If data is sent to Precog with acknowledgement turned on, then the request will not return until after the data has been committed to the transaction log, at which point the data can be considered secure and will eventually be available for analysis.</p>
                <p>Precog is an eventually consistent data store, so that writes may not immediately be reflected in reads (although in practice, the delay is usually quite small, on the order of a couple seconds).</p>
                <h3>Where is Precog Cloud hosted?</h3>
                <p>Precog's cloud offering is hosted in a variety of data centers to maximize availability and performance.</p>
                <h3>Is Precog Cloud built on Hadoop, Cassandra or something else?</h3>
                <p>Precog Cloud is original technology highly-optimized for storing, processing, and analyzing persistent data. It is not built on any other database technology.</p>
                <h3>How does Precog differ from NoSQL databases?</h3>
                <p>NoSQL databases are designed to store entities, such as people, places, and things. Precog is designed to store persistent data, like events that describe what users are doing, events that describe what a system is doing, or the results of a survey or poll. Both NoSQl databases and Precog are capable of storing rich, multi-structured data that doesnt rigidly conform to predefined schemas. The technologies work very well together.</p>
                <p>NoSQL databases make it easy to store and update entity-oriented data. Precog makes it easy to store, process, and deeply analyze persistent data. Many use cases that are hard or impossible with NoSQL databases are very straightforward using Precog.</p>
                <h3>How does Precog Differ from Hadoop / Cassandra?</h3>
                <p>Hadoop is a distributed file system, which makes it easy to store any kind of data. Hadoop is often used to store persistent data, but Hadoop only provides low-level, batch-oriented ways of analyzing data. Precog is not a file system, it is a high-level data science platform that lets you perform data wrangling and in-store analytics, statistics, and machine learning.</p>
                <h3>What makes Precog different than operational databases?</h3>
                <p>Operational databases are designed to store mutable data, such as people, places, and things. Precog is designed to store, process, and analyze persistent data, such as clickstream data, transactional data, log data, sensor data, and measurement data. Although many operational databases provide a way to perform basic aggregation, they cannot be used to perform data wrangling, and in-store analytics, statistics, and machine learning.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog support other databases?</h3>
                <p>Yes. Precog is designed to work well with your existing operational database. Precog can import data from both NoSQL databases and relational databases.</p>
                <h3>What are the current limits of the beta version of Precog?</h3>
                <p>For maximum performance, the beta is limited to the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>Less than a terabyte of data.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>250 or fewer values per record.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Only top-level inequalities.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>These limitations will be lifted when Precog emerges from beta.</p>
                <h3>Does Precog provide an on-premises solution?</h3>
                <p>Precog is still in beta, but please contact us if you are interested in an on-premises solution.</p>
                <h3>How do ReportGrid and Labcoat relate to Precog?</h3>
                <p>ReportGrid is an HTML5 visualization engine that connects to Precog. ReportGrid can be used to interactively or programmatically build charts and reports. Many customers use ReportGrid and Precog to deploy self-service reporting inside their applications.</p>
                <p>Labcoat is an HTML5 app built on the Precog API that makes it easy to integrate and analyze data. Labcoat has built-in help, syntax highlighting, and data management. Many developers use Labcoat to analyze data, then export the analysis as code that runs inside their applications.</p>
                <p>Both ReportGrid and Labcoat can be embedded inside your application, white-labeled, and exposed to your end-users.</p>
