            <h3>Full API encryption.</h3>
            <p>Every interaction between you and the Precog API is protected with unbreakable 2048-bit RSA encryption. We don't charge extra for this feature -- it comes standard even on free accounts.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Data stewardship.</h3>
            <p>Your data is your data. As per our terms of service, we don't have permission to do anything with it, except host the data and provide analytical services to you. You can export or delete data whenever you like, and delete your account anytime.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Physical security.</h3>
            <p>We only host your data in cloud providers that far exceed HIPAA requirements. Our primary data center is secured with electronic access cards, manned 24x7x365, and has multiple closed circuit cameras monitored by a third-party.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Enterprise-grade security model.</h3>
            <p>Our comprehensive, hierarchical multi-tenant, capability-based security model protects all your data, and lets you securely provide fine-grained permissions to third-parties. Monitor and revoke permissions at any time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Storage-level encryption.</h3>
            <p>We encrypt all data with strong AES 256-bit encryption. Even in the event of a physical breach of our data center, your data would be completely safe.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Best security practices.</h3>
            <p>Our servers use web server software that is not vulnerable to injection attacks or traditional web server exploits. The server code is <a href="https://github.com/jdegoes/blueeyes">open source</a> and is available for anyone to audit.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Curated ecosystem.</h3>
            <p>All third-parties providing add-ons in the Precog marketplace are opt-in, and they are required to undergo a rigorous certification process. They're not allowed to persist any data, or even collect aggregate data unless you allow them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Fanatical support.</h3>
